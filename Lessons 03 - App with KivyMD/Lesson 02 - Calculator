01 pip install buildozer


02 Create new folder and run the following command via Terminal: $ buildozer init


03 This will create a buildozer.spec file that you’ll use to configure your build.
For this example, you can edit the first few lines of the spec file as follows:
[app]

# (str) Title of your application
title = KvCalc

# (str) Package name
package.name = kvcalc

# (str) Package domain (needed for android/ios packaging)
package.domain = org.kvcalc


04 Feel free to browse the rest of the file to see what else you can change.
At this point, you’re almost ready to build your application, but first, you’ll want to install the dependencies for buildozer.
dependencies = https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#targeting-android


05 Once those are installed, copy your calculator application into your new folder and rename it to main.py.
This is required by buildozer. If you don’t have the file named correctly, then the build will fail.
Now you can run the following command:
$ buildozer -v android debug
