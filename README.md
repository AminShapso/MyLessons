##  Lessons 01 (2023)


Lesson 01 - Waves.py
Synopsis: Plotting sine and cosine waves using matplotlib and numpy.
Key takeaway: With np.arange() you can use floats (instead of only ints).

Lesson 02 - Functions.py
Synopsis: The key differences between variables and objects
Key takeaway: Objects are always sent by reference to functions/methods.

Lesson 03 - Types.py
Synopsis: Learning different types.
Key takeaway: Object should by copied using the .copy() method.

Lesson 04 - Read data from CSV.py
Synopsis: Reading Comma Separated Values manually by delimiting them.
Key takeaway: Using pandas is much easier.

Lesson 05 - Read text.py
Synopsis: Reading texts as CSVs.
Key takeaway: N/A.

Lesson 06 - print.py
Synopsis: Different types of print().
Key takeaway: Best method is to use “Live Templates” to make your own types of print().

Lesson 07 - Sums.py
Synopsis: How to sum a list quickly. 
Key takeaway: Python is the best math tool.

Lesson 08 - Loops.py
Synopsis: Loops, break, and continue.
Key takeaway: Strings can be looped into their characters.

Lesson 09 - Classes and Inheritance.py
Synopsis: Classes and Inheritance - part 01.
Key takeaway: N/A.

Lesson 10 - Data using Pandas.py
Synopsis: Reading CSVs with pandas.
Key takeaway: N/A.

Lesson 11 - Overload Methods.py
Synopsis: When working with languages that can discriminate data types at compile-time, selecting among the alternatives can occur at compile-time. Python is a dynamically typed language, so the concept of overloading simply does not apply to it.
Key takeaway: Multiple dispatch (or multimethods) is the feature of some object-oriented programming languages in which a function or method can be dynamically dispatched based on the run time (dynamic) type of more than one of its arguments.

Lesson 12 - My Family.py
Synopsis: Classes and Inheritance - part 02.
Key takeaway: N/A.



##  Lessons 02 (2024)


Lesson 01 - Logics.py
Synopsis: Logical operations.
Key takeaway: The “==” operator compares the value or equality of two objects; whereas the Python "is" operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory… In short, you can use "is" only for True / False / None statements.

Lesson 02 - Dictionaries.py
Synopsis: Using Dictionaries to output user messages.
Key takeaway: N/A.

Lesson 03 - Dictionaries and Lambdas.py
Synopsis: Using a Dictionary as a Library of operations (or lambdas).
Key takeaway: N/A.

Lesson 04 - SolarEdge FC.py
Synopsis: Sorting players into groups using combinations.
Key takeaway: This is not an easy task for large groups.

Lesson 05 - braking loops.py
Synopsis: Using yield inside a loop to control the length of the loop.
Key takeaway: yield is best used when you have a function that returns a sequence and you want to iterate over that sequence, but you do not need to have every value in memory at once.

Lesson 06 - Precedence of Operators.py
Synopsis: https://pythonflood.com/python-operator-precedence-simplifying-complex-expressions-22eb46b334
Key takeaway: The order for Logical operations: NOT → right to left; AND → left to right; OR → left to right.



##  Lessons 03 - App with KivyMD


Lessons 03 - App with KivyMD\Lesson 01 - Useful Examples.py
Synopsis: A simple Kivy GUI.
Key takeaway: N/A.

Lessons 03 - App with KivyMD\Lesson 02 - Calculator.py
Synopsis: A simple Kivy Calculator GUI.
Key takeaway: N/A.



##  Tests


Test 01 (22-01-2024).py
Synopsis: The concept of overflow.
Key takeaway:N/A.
